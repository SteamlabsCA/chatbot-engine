Welcome to the SteamLabs Chatbot Engine!
=================

Click `Show` in the header to see your chatbot live. Updates to your code will instantly deploy and update live.

Remix and edit the code to get a different response from the engine!

Once remixed, enter your session key provided by ***Need Session key Provider***	

Now, you can have a dialogue with any of the built in characters. You can also customize your engine to talk to more characters by adding additional movie scripts.

#### Add more movie characters...

1. Notice on the left bar menu, there is a folder called assets. In this folder, there are a few default movies that this engine has built in. In the “Your Characters/” folder you can add your own movie character lines. 

2. Visit the Github repository:[https://github.com/AndyForest/AI-Models/tree/master/Movie%20Mashup%20Chatbot/Movie%20lines](https://github.com/AndyForest/AI-Models/tree/master/Movie%20Mashup%20Chatbot/Movie%20lines)

3. Select a movie of your choice

4. Select the character you would like to speak to

5. Copy all the script lines of that character

6. Now, go back to this glitch site and paste those lines in the “character1.txt” window

7. You can rename the file title, “character1.txt” to the actual character’s name for clarity

8. You can always edit and add more lines to your character script to customize  their response. 


Tired of hearing certain names, and phrases from the chatbot responses? You can select a word from the script and the GPT2 response engine will automatically generate text based on your conversation to substitute your selected word.

#### Replacing text in the movie script...
1. To consistently replace a particular word in the whole movie script by putting **“<>”** around the word. For example: “It's **<Woody>**!” will make all “Woody”s change to a word/s generated by the chatbot 
  
2. **IMPORTANT!** Text that you want to replace MUST be located at the end of the script line. 
  
3. **For example:**
  - Son of a building block! It's <Woody>!
