Now, you can have a dialogue with any of the built in characters. You can also customize your engine to talk to more characters by adding additional movie scripts.

#### Add more movie characters...

2. Visit github: https://github.com/AndyForest/AI-Models/tree/master/Movie%20Mashup%20Chatbot/Movie%20lines   [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

3. Select a movie of your choice

4. Select the character you would like to speak to

5. Copy all the script lines of that character

6. Now, go back to this glitch site and paste those lines in the “character1.txt” window

7. You can rename the file title, “character1.txt” to the actual character’s name for clarity

8. You can always edit and add more lines to your character script to customize  their response.
